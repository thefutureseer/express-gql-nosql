Some general guidance on how to pick a religion:
1. Research: Do your research and learn as much as you can about different religions and spiritual traditions. This can include reading religious texts, attending services or ceremonies, and speaking with people who practice the religion.
2. Examine your beliefs: Take some time to reflect on your own beliefs, values, and spiritual experiences. Consider what is most important to you and what resonates with you on a deeper level.
3. Seek guidance: If you have friends or family members who practice a particular religion, you may want to seek their guidance and insights. Alternatively, you can reach out to a spiritual leader or counselor for advice and support.
4. Attend services: Attend religious services or ceremonies to get a better sense of what it's like to practice the religion. Observe how the community interacts and how the rituals are performed.
5. Listen to your intuition: Ultimately, the decision of which religion to choose should be based on what feels right to you. Listen to your intuition and trust your instincts.
Remember that choosing a religion is a personal decision and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. It is important to take your time and make an informed decision based on your own beliefs, values, and spiritual experiences.

FIRST RELIGION ON EARTH?

 I need to clarify that the concept of "first religions on earth" is a subject of ongoing research and debate among scholars, as the development of religion and spirituality is shrouded in prehistory and archaeological evidence is limited. However, based on available information, here is a list of some of the earliest known religious traditions:

1. Animism - a belief that all things, including objects in nature, have spirits or souls, and should be treated with respect and reverence. This belief is thought to have originated in Africa over 100,000 years ago.
    1.  It is difficult to say what spiritual practices existed before animism, as the development of religion and spirituality is shrouded in prehistory and archaeological evidence is limited. However, some scholars suggest that the earliest human spiritual practices may have involved the worship of ancestors or the veneration of powerful natural forces, such as the sun, moon, and stars. Others propose that shamanic practices, which involve communicating with spirits and other non-physical entities, may have been one of the earliest forms of human spirituality. Ultimately, the specific nature and origins of prehistoric spiritual practices remain a subject of ongoing research and debate.
